What is Customer Segmentation?
Customer segmentation is a method of dividing customers into groups or clusters on the basis of common characteristics.

Importance of Customer Segmentation in Marketing.
We are in the times of "customised/personalised experience". Irrespective of the business one is in, we want to deliver the best experiences to our customers and this begins by understanding different needs of different customers. We want to learn from these needs and group the customers accordingly. This exercise of customer segmentation then helps us design our marketing strategies better so they only hear about stuff they relate to and frankly, care the most about.

A marketing strategy without customer segmentation is like shooting in the dark and yet hoping for maximum success - not a great strategy in today's age.

Customer Segmentation improves the quality of service, loyalty, and retention; it provides opportunities for upselling and cross-selling and it helps companies to stay a step ahead of competitors.

Customer Segmentation using RFM analysis.
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a behavior-based approach grouping customers into segments. It groups the customers on the basis of their previous purchase transactions.
Recency (R): Who have purchased recently? Number of days since last purchase (least recency)
Frequency (F): Who has purchased frequently? It means the total number of purchases. ( high frequency)
Monetary Value(M): Who have high purchase amount? It means the total money customer spent (high monetary value)
