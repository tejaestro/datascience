Assignment - 

In driver_data.csv, you are given a dataset of delivery fleet driver data. For each driver we have two features: mean distance driven per day and the mean percentage of time a driver was >5 mph over the speed limit.

1. Run the K-Means algorithm on this dataset and find the optimal number of clusters. What insights can you gather from these clusters?
2. Perform Agglomerative clustering on the same dataset with an appropriate number of clusters. Plot the dendrogram.
3. Compare the results from your K-Means model and your Hierarchical clustering model using silhouette scores. Which model is superior?
